# Comparison of spike sorters on Neuropixels recording with SpikeInterface

@author : Alessio Buccino


Dataset acquired by Andre Marques-Smith et al , downloadable from [crcns.org](http://dx.doi.org/10.6080/K0J67F4T).

In this example we analyze the recording `c1` using several spike sorters and extract their consensus.
You can download the `c1.ta.gz`, unpack it, and place it in this folder.

The `main_script.py` does all the loading, preprocessing, spike sorting, comparison, and plotting.
